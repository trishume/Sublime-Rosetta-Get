# Sublime Rosetta Code

Simple sublime text plugin I made. It allows you to quickly insert snippets from rosetta code:
http://rosettacode.org/

##What it does

When invoked, it detects the current file language and pops up a search menu of all the Rosetta Code tasks implemented in that language.
When a task is selected it is inserted into the current document.
